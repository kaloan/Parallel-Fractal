# Parallel-Fractal

A project for a university course on parallel processing. <br>

Doesn't look very pretty (~90s fractals), as that is a result of the colour function. More complicated methods are used for modern colouring of this type of fractals. <br>

The output is a .ppm file, essentially a bitmap. Since not a lot of programs may open it, you may need to convert it to another format.
